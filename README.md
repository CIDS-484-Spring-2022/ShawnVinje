Task management web application built using the NetBeans IDE and the WAMP server package, which includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache server, in order to host the website.
This also came with PhpMyAdmin which is a GUI interface for interacting with the MySQL.
Also the project will follow the model view controller class architecture.

This project will allow users to create their own accounts to create and store tasks that they want to keep records of and revisit in the future.
I currently have created and connected the database as well as created an initial sign up page.

Since then, I have created a page to list all tasks that a user currently has, as well as pages for creating and deleting tasks which have links on the tasks page.

Currently working on fixing the update tasks page as well as adding the full functionality of creating an account and logging in.
