Task management web application built with PHP and MySQL running on Apache

This project will allow users to create their own accounts to create and store tasks that they want to keep records of and revisit in the future.
I currently have created and connected the database as well as created an initial sign up page.

I am using the NetBeans IDE and created a PHP project inside of it.
Also I am using the WAMP server package, which includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache server, in order to host the website.
This also came with PhpMyAdmin which is a GUI interface for interacting with the MySQL.
The project will follow the model view controller class architecture.
